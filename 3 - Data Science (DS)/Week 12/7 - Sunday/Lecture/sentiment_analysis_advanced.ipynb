    "### **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text. In this advanced notebook, we will explore techniques to improve sentiment analysis by addressing some of the limitations of the basic approach, such as handling sarcasm, irony, and complex language structures.\n",
    "### **Polarity and Subjectivity**\n",
    "Polarity is a measure of the positive or negative orientation of a text, ranging from -1 to 1. Subjectivity refers to the extent to which a text expresses personal opinions or feelings, ranging from 0 to 1.\n",
    "### **Handling Sarcasm and Irony**\n",
    "Sarcasm and irony can be challenging for sentiment analysis models to interpret correctly. One approach to handle this is to use a sarcasm detection model alongside the sentiment analysis model. We can train a separate model specifically for sarcasm detection using labeled data and incorporate its predictions into the sentiment analysis pipeline."
