    "### __Sentiment Analysis__\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text. It involves classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on the sentiment conveyed by the words and phrases used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Polarity__\n",
    "Polarity is a measure of the positive or negative orientation of a text. It represents the degree to which a text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. Polarity scores typically range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a highly negative sentiment, 0 represents a neutral sentiment, and 1 indicates a highly positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Subjectivity__\n",
    "Subjectivity refers to the extent to which a text expresses personal opinions, beliefs, or feelings, rather than factual information. It measures how subjective or opinionated a text is. Subjectivity scores usually range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a highly objective text and 1 indicates a highly subjective text."

      "Review: I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.\n",
