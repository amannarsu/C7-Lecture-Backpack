# Notable Open Source Projects!

In this class, we spoke about modularisation, use case and sequence diagrams. Those are important concepts to use at the workspace, mostly when sending ideas across your team or important stakeholders. 


# 1 - [ItsDangerous](https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/tree/main/src/itsdangerous)

Various helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it back safe and sound. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a token has not been tampered with.
The most important take away is the folder **src** folder located at [src](https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/tree/main/src/itsdangerous). You will note how each file has a specific name and functionality. Each of those functionalities are tested in the folder [test](https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/tree/main/tests/test_itsdangerous) .

# 2 - [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

For those who will be doing Machine Learning, they will encounter a lot of Pytorch. You will not necessarily need to implement something in it directly, but it's good to know how it works. You can have a look at the [torch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/torch) folder. 

# 3 - [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3)

For those who will work with AWS platform, will not miss boto3 if they use python. The source code shows you how they implement things.

Feel free to check them, you won't break anything!
