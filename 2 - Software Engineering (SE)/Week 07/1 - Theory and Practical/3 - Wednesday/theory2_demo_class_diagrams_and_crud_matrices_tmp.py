Design a simple Library System for a local library. 
The system should allow librarians to manage book inventory, 
handle borrowing and returning books, and keep track of library members.

"""     -------- CRUD Matrix --------
•	Create a CRUD Matrix to outline the CRUD operations 
    for each class in your Class Diagram.
•	Specify the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations 
    for classes like Book, Member, and BorrowingRecord.
•	Consider who has permission to perform each operation 
    (e.g., Librarian can add, update, and delete Books, 
    while Members can only read and borrow Books).
•	Provide justification for the access permissions assigned to each operation.
